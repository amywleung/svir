# Introduction

As natural hazards and disasters occur with greater frequency and intensity, it is imperative to build community resilience to preserve life and property. Mitigation strategies and preparedness plans have been established throughout the US as a result, simultaneously minimizing hazard and disaster damages and qualifying municipal and state governments for federal disaster and emergency response dollars. While these mitigation and preparedness plans are intended to minimize risk for *all* lives, they are especially important among socially vulnerable communities. Despite a conceptual awareness of social vulnerability among industry professionals, there are few authoritative sources to consult when attempting to quantify social vulnerability, resulting in different interpretations of vulnerable characteristics from one entity to another. 

The variability across communities with respect to demographics, socioeconomic statuses, and accessibility presents a challenge for emergency and disaster management entities when devising new mitigation and preparedness plans, namely in that a one-size-fits-all approach to community capacity building does not exist. Vulnerability may not be uniformly or equally distributed across any one particular area, and different communities may have drastically different types of needs. Though this variability renders social vulnerability a nebulous measure to quantify, in their seminal 2003 paper, [Cutter et al.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6237.8402002/abstract) developed a US-oriented Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) in an attempt to create a foundational measure of social vulnerability. The SoVI used 11 independent factors in an additive model to identify social vulnerability to environmental hazards throughout the US [(Cutter et al. 2003)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6237.8402002/abstract). Though this model accounts for an impressive 76% of variance in vulnerability, researchers acknowledged that local effects are present, as the "factors that contribute to the overall score often are different for each county, underscoring the interactive nature of social vulnerability" [(Cutter et al. 2003, p. 242)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6237.8402002/abstract). 

[Cutter et al.'s](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6237.8402002/abstract) 2003 SoVI laid the foundation for the most recent iteration of the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), developed jointly by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Environmental Health, Office of Terrorism Preparedness and Emergency
Response (OTPER), and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry's (ATSDR) Geospatial Research, Analysis, and Services Program in 2011 [(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention et al.)](https://svi.cdc.gov/Documents/Data/A%20Social%20Vulnerability%20Index%20for%20Disaster%20Management.pdf). To date, this SVI from the CDC and ATSDR is considered one of the few, if only, authoritative sources within the emergency and disaster management industry in pre- and post-disaster activities. Despite its prominent role as an authoritative source on social vulnerability, the SVI in its current form does not take into account the variability of different communities. Rather, it is a ranked measure that compares relative social vulnerability calculated at the nation and statewide scales [(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention et al. 2011)](https://svi.cdc.gov/Documents/Data/A%20Social%20Vulnerability%20Index%20for%20Disaster%20Management.pdf). In other words, social vulnerability is calculated using a percentile ranking method that ranks **all** US census tracts against one another for the nationwide SVI product (e.g. social vulnerability in rural Kansas is directly compared to social vulnerability in Chicago), or against other census tracts within a state for the statewide product (e.g. social vulnerability in upstate New York is directly compared to social vulnerability in New York City). The scale of analysis of either existing product may still be too coarse to identify potential regional variation in demographic, socioeconomic, and accessibility characteristics. Additionally, the inclusion of all US census tracts in an SVI calculation for a regional disaster would make little sense. For example, if tornadoes affected rural Oklahoma, it would not be appropriate to include SVI rankings for census tracts in Washington state. 

Based on previous findings from [Cutter et al. (2003)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6237.8402002/abstract), it is clear that the 2011 SVI also suffers from the same Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) when ranking areal units at a national or statewide scale. That is, SVI scores vary at differing levels of analysis due to the potential variability in community demographics and other socioeconomic and accessibility variables at local, state, and national levels. The primary aim of this project is to address the MAUP using a Shiny web application that dynamically calculates SVI for a user's specified Area of Interest (AOI). The user can upload a shapefile as points, lines, or polygons, and the resulting regional SVI can be downloaded as a .CSV or shapefile. While this process provides a means to examine SVI [Cutter et al. (2003)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6237.8402002/abstract) without the influence of non-local census tract vulnerability, it introduces a new problem. Because the index is a relative measure, all census tracts considered will always fall on a scale from 0 to 1, regardless of true variability between them. Thus, all areas in an AOI are similarly vulnerable, an application of this regional calculation would result in index values that suggest disparate vulnerabilities, when in fact the true degree of variability in social vulnerability is negligible. To address these particular cases, the web application also hosts an interactive dashboard illustrating each of the 15 thematic indicators for a selected census tract, and markers indicating where each thematic domain of the selected census tract falls in relation to the thematic domains in the nationwide dataset. This visualization is intended to provide users with a relative understanding of where a particular census tract falls in relation to its comparable national measure. The interactive SVI tool completed for this course is meant to be a prototype for a more refined SVI tool that allows users to adjust weighting schemes for each thematic indicator or thematic domain. 

Introduction Section `DOL:A`

# Setup

## PostgreSQL/PostGIS

Currently, in order to interface with the SVIR package and Shiny application interface, one must have a correctly configured PostgreSQL database, with the PostGIS extension enabled. This is a simple process, and instructions are laid out in this document.

PostgreSQL is a free, open source, and well documented database server. Implementations of PostgreSQL are available for Window, MacOS, and Linux operating systems, all of which have installation documentation through the [Postgres website](https://www.postgresql.org/).

### Installing PostgreSQL

The installer for PostgreSQL can be found on the [downloads page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) of the PostgreSQL website. This project was created using PostgreSQL version 10.1.2, but versions 9.x should be compatible. Make sure to select the installer, and follow the instructions that are appropriate for your operating system. In the installation process, the authors of this package recommend that you choose to install pgAdmin4, a graphic user interface for managing postgres databases.

At several instances in the setup process, you will be prompted to select default or custom parameters. A user of this packages has two options: input their own choices for these parameters and change the package code appropriately, OR select the input choices specified in the following section. In the latter case, our package will work without modification.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
Parameters <- c("user", "password", "server host", "port", "database name")
Defaults <- c("postgres", "gisde2018", "localhost", "5432", "svir")
parTable <- cbind(Parameters, Defaults)

kable(parTable, caption = "Parameters and Defaults")

```

### PostGIS

Upon installing PostgreSQL, a prompt should appear for `Stackbuilder`. This utility automatically takes care of software compatibility issues, and allows a user to access a multitude of PostgreSQL modules and extensions, including PostGIS. We recommend using `Stackbuilder` to install the PostGIS extension, though it can be completed independently. Therefore, select the PostgreSQL database you have created (identified by the port number). After this, you will have the option of installing various application extensions through `Stackbuilder`, including PostGIS (under the 'Spatial Extensions' category). 

### Creating Database

Once PostgreSQL and PostGIS are fully installed, you can set up your PostgreSQL database. Do this by opening pgAdmin4, clicking on  "databases" in the browser tab, and selecting "create", and "database". In the prompt window, you must name your new database (the default for this package is `svir`).

Once you have created the database, open the "query tool" for your new database, and enter and run the following SQL statement:
```
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
```

This statement will update your database to include PostGIS functionalities.


### Downloading and Importing Data

The data needed for this package is currently hosted by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry on their [Social Vulnerability Downloads page](https://svi.cdc.gov/SVIDataToolsDownload.html). The file you wish to download is called "SVI 2014 Tract Shapefile (US)". Download the shapefile, and extract it to your chosen storage directory.


Installed along with PostGIS is a graphic user interface "PostGIS Shapefile Import/Export Manager" utility for importing `shapefiles` directly into PostGIS. This utility is called "shp2pgsql-gui", and can be found in the PostgreSQL program directory (In a Windows environment, this should look similar to the following:`C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\10\bin\postgisgui`). Open this utility, and update the information in the "View connection details" window (see table above for defaults). Then, open the "Add File" menu, and navigate to the directory in which you saved the "SVI 2014 Tract Shapefile (US)" file, and select the shapefile. After these steps, press the "import" button, and the shapefile should be loaded into your PostgreSQL, with an appropriate spatial index. You must enter one final SQL statement in order to complete the database/data setup process:
```
SELECT UpdateGeometrySRID('svi2014_us', 'geom', 4269);
```

This statement updates the table coordinate system so the data can be projected onto the leaflet output map. 

Setup Section `DOL:M`

# Methods

## PostgreSQL and PostGIS

In total, the dataset in shapefile format is 423MB. By the project's very nature, one should never have to utilize the entire dataset of over 72,000 census tracts. Thus, by storing this dataset in PostgreSQL, one can query by geometry, and subset out exclusively those census tracts within the AOI. In this manner, a much more appropriate volume of data can be loaded into computer memory and manipulated in R.

The SVI shapefile for this project was loaded into PostgreSQL and the preservation of geometries was made possible in PostGIS. The database is currently hosted locally. 

PostgreSQL and PostGIS Section `DOL:M`

## Shiny - develop interactive web application for users to upload/download SVI for their AOIs

The [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) package provides a framework for developing web applications directly in R. It provides the functionality to create interactive web service components through event observation and reactive inputs and outputs, as well as a plethora of integrated widgets. Shiny provides the foundation upon which this application was built.

The two primary components of this application are the `ui.R` and `server.R` scripts. The `ui.R` script primarily contains two types of functions, inputs and outputs, while the `server.R` script recieves those inputs and generates outputs that are displayed through the `ui.R` script. In the `ui.R` script for this project uses several input functions, including 'select input' (rendered as drop down menus), 'check box group input' (rendered as check boxes), 'radio button input' (rendered as radio buttons), 'file input' (rendered as an upload file button). Values associated with these inputs change depending on a users selection (e.g. a radio button), and that determines the nature of an action in the `server.R` script and ultimately the contents of an output variable (e.g. generate specific file type for download). In the case of the custom functions in this package (e.g. `mapStyle`), inputs determine the parameters that go into the function, and the product of that function becomes the output value that is returned to a rendering function in the `ui.R` script.

Shiny Section `DOL:M`

## Packages

1.  `rgdal`

    The [rgdal](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rgdal/versions/1.2-16) package provided our project with the ability to read in a user input shapefile to determine AOI, transform the coordinate reference system of that shapefile, and to output the regional SVI product in shapefile format.


2.  `RPostgreSQL`

    The [RPostgreSQL](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RPostgreSQL/index.html) package provides PostgreSQL driver, and the functionality to create the connection object between R and PostgreSQL. In this project, RPostgreSQL was a prerequisite package in order to utilize the `rpostgis` package.

3.  `rpostgis`

    The [rpostgis](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rpostgis/versions/1.3.0/topics/rpostgis) package enables an interface with PostGIS through R, and includes functions to allow for some of the basic functionalities of PostGIS. In this project, the `pgGetGeom` function is used to read in Census Tracts and their associated SVI variable data, from a PostgreSQL database. Specifically, a SQL query is passed to that function, which allows for an intersection operation to occur in the PostgreSQL in order to return only a subset of the national census tract dataset.

4.  `sp`

    The [sp](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/sp/versions/1.2-5) package provided the interface for working with S4 spatial data classes. In this project, only the spatialpolygonsdataframe S4 class was used. The user input shapefile AOI, and the resulting table queried from the PostgreSQL database table are both treated as spatialpolygonsdataframes in R.

5.  `leaflet`

    The [leaflet](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/leaflet/versions/1.1.0) package provides a direct interface in R to the leaflet webmapping JavaScript library. This library allows for the production of interactive web map object, including a base map, and customized data visualization and map-feature pop-ups. 

6.  `viridis`

    The [veridis](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/viridis/versions/0.3.4) package allows access to a wide range of color scales for plotting and graphics purposes. In this project, the default "viridis" palette was used to symbolize census tract polygons. 

7. `DT`

    The [DT](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/DT/versions/0.2) (or Data-Table) package provides a means of rendering and customize an interactive data-table. In this project, the DT package was used to render and style two data-tables in the "Data Table" tab.

8. `leaflet.extras`

    The [leaflet.extras](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/leaflet.extras/versions/0.2) package is an extension of the `leaflet` package. The package provides additional functionality available in the JavaScript leaflet package. In this project, the `leaflet.extras` package will be used in the future to allow for a user defined AOI to be drawn on the map. 

9. `plotly`

    The [plotly](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/plotly/versions/4.7.1) package allows for interactive plots in web-browser that appear similar to plots generated from the `ggplot2` package. In this project, `plotly` was used to generate the interactive dashboard, including bar charts showing the values of SVI variables at each census tract, as well as box-plots showing the distribution of regional census tract values at the nation-wide scale. 

Packages Section `DOL:M`

## Custom Functions

### `svi_calc`

The SVI is calculated in the `svi_calc` function using a multi-tiered approach as outlined in the [(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention et al. 2011)](https://svi.cdc.gov/Documents/Data/A%20Social%20Vulnerability%20Index%20for%20Disaster%20Management.pdf) paper. First, an array of raw variables from the 2010 – 2014 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates at the census tract level are aggregated into 15 thematic indicators, then transformed into percentile ranks. Next, the percentile ranks of the 15 thematic indicators are combined and transformed into percentile ranks of four thematic domains, as follows: Socioeconomic Status, Housing Composition and Disability, Minority Status and Language, and Housing and Transportation. Finally, overall SVI is calculated by summing the percentile ranks of the four thematic domains, then transforming those values into percentile ranks for the final SVI scores. At the end of this process, each of the 15 thematic indicators and four thematic domains are evaluated, and the top 10% most vulnerable census tracts are assigned variable flags. These flags act as a mechanism to highlight the census tracts containing the most vulnerable populations for each of the 15 thematic indicators and four thematic domains. This allows for a maintained awareness of extreme vulnerabilities in selected variables, that would otherwise be lost in the generalization process that occurs when aggregating variables to thematic domains [(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention et al. 2011)](https://svi.cdc.gov/Documents/Data/A%20Social%20Vulnerability%20Index%20for%20Disaster%20Management.pdf).

`svi_calc` Section `DOL:A`

### `mapStyle`

The `mapStyle` function creates and styles a Leaflet proxy map using a Leaflet map object, a shapefile, one of five SVI thematic domains, and a flag variable field designating top 10% most vulnerable census tracts. In order to use this function, users must first create a Leaflet map object, which initializes an empty Leaflet map containing a basemap and a default map zoom setting. Users then initialize a Leaflet proxy using the `mapStyle` function, which allows users to add legends, symbology, polygons, and custom zoom settings all at once to their original Leaflet map object without re-rendering a Leaflet map object each time a map element is added.

`mapStyle` Section `DOL:A`

### `makeDash`

The `makeDash` function creates and styles a series of bar charts that illustrate the regional SVI Tier 1 variable values of a designated census tract, categorized by thematic domain. This function takes two parameters, "shp" and "uid". The "shp" parameter indicates the data set, and the "uid" parameter is populated by an "on-click" event of a census tract polygon in the leaflet map object.  The bar charts themselves are the output of the `plot_ly` function from the `plotly` package.

`makeDash` Section `DOL:M`

### `makeBox`



`makeBox` Section `DOL:M`

### `launchApp`

The `launchApp` function launches the Shiny web application by searching the `/application` subfolder in the `svir` package and using the `server.R` and `ui.R` scripts. This function takes no input parameters.

`launchApp` Section `DOL:A`

# Results

## Summary of Results

This project has culminated in the development of a fully functional Shiny application and user interface. This application has several primary component parts: the capacity to upload a shapefile to delimit an AOI, a function to recalculate the full spectrum of SVI values and flags for that AOI, a function to render those SVI values on a leaflet webmap object interface, a function to render a descriptive dashboard for elements selected from that webmap interface, a series of box plots to further describe the spread of SVI variability within the AOI, an interactive data-table that allows for a tabular view of the SVI data, and the ability to download the correctly formatted SVI data in a comma separated values, or shapefile file format.

## Application Examples

Below are multiple examples of use cases for this regional SVI calculation package.

### Hurricane Sandy Path

The 2012 Hurricane Sandy event had significant disruptive and destructive impacts on the United States, primarily in eastern seaboard states, but also inland areas as far as upstate New York, West Virginia, and Ohio. The effects of this storm included ocean storm surges generally between one and three meters in height, high winds, and heavy precipitation. The most heavily affected areas were in coastal New York, and New Jersey, and included floods, power outages, destroyed structures, infrastructure damage, and shoreline erosion. Further inland, high winds, power outages, and heavy snow precipitation were also problematic ([National Hurricane Center Sandy Tropical Cyclone Report](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/AL182012_Sandy.pdf)).

In this catastrophic event, access to a regional SVI calculation and visualization tool could be useful for planning agencies in order to begin the analytics involved with disaster relief allocation planning. Using only the boundary of Hurricane Sandy's path of destruction through the northeast  United States, one can easily derive such a regional SVI, using this package. Below, one can see the results of uploading such a storm track shapefile into the regional SVI Shiny application.

```{r, out.width = "900px", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Regional SVI for Hurricane Sandy - Main Page" }
knitr::include_graphics("../vignettes/figs/examples/sandy_mainpage_flag.png")
```

This is a very large regional example, and as such, one can pan and zoom to different locations on the map that are of particular interest. In this example, one particular census tract has been highlighted, and its SVI metrics are displayed in the dashboard. As one can see, the overall SVI ranking for this census tract is quite low (.18 on a scale of 0-1). While that statistic implies that this census tract is likely more resilient to the damages inflicted by this disaster, the dashboard statistics tell a different story. Specifically, there is a flag for the "Mobile Home" category, and the "Population Aged 65+ category is quite high. In a disaster which brought high winds and heavy precipitation, one might consider mobile dwellings to be particularly vulnerable. In addition, populations aged 65+ might be more adversely affected than other populations by extended power outages.

```{r, out.width = "900px", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Regional SVI for Hurricane Sandy - Download" }
knitr::include_graphics("../vignettes/figs/examples/sandy_downloadSHP.png")
```

Though the analytic capabilities of this Shiny application afford a user a robust means of exploring this data, with such a large area, it is likely a user would wish to further explore and manipulate this data in their own GIS or scripting environment. Therefore, by selecting the ".shp" checkbox, a user can quickly download the data displayed in the `leaflet` map, and explore it at their leisure.


### Madison, WI 

The Madison Area Transportation Planning Board is an organization that cooperates with the Wisconsin Department of Transportation, the Federal Highway Administration, and the Federal Transit Administration in the transportation planning process for the Madison, WI metropolitan area. This agency is partly responsible for funding allocation for different transportation undertakings, and must comply with state and federal laws. This agency takes part in the planning process for a wide range of transportation related infrastructures, including public transit (buses, trains), air traffic, highways, bicycles, and more. 

```{r, out.width = "900px", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Metro. Planning Area - Madison Area Transportation Planning Board - [Regional Transportation Plan 2050](http://www.madisonareampo.org/planning/documents/RTP_2050_Appendix_D_FINAL.pdf)" }
knitr::include_graphics("../vignettes/figs/examples/madison_MPOboundary.png")
```

As this agency has a wide range of responsibilities, and interacts with numerous other local, state, and federal agencies. As such, it must take into consideration a wide range of variables describing the region for which it is responsible. A tool such as the regional SVI derived in this package might be quite useful to an agency such as the TPB.

# Discussion

## Limitations - 

1.  Package Dependencies

2.  users must currently have a postgreSQL/PostGIS db set up exactly like ours for the app to run 

3.  Calculation Time / Polygon Rendering

4.  many attribute fields, difficult to examine all at once in DT


## Improvements - 

1.  Options for AOI Polygon Input

    In its current form, the Shiny application only takes one form of input for a user defined AOI. While shapefiles are a very common file format, the application would be more versitile if it could accept different file formats (e.g. geojson, sqlite, kml, etc.). In addition, the `leaflet.extras` package provides a functionality for drawing points, lines, and polygons on a leaflet map object. The authors of the package would like to allow a user to define their AOI simply by drawing a polygon on the map. This functionality would enable a user to interact with the Shiny application without any perpared geospatial information.

2.  Highlight Polygon

    In its current form, one can populate the dashboard and box-plots with information about a polygon selected from the leaflet map object. Currently, there is no means of tracking which polygon has been selected on the map object. Adding the functionality of a highlighted outline to a polygon after it has been selected will allow a user to more easily identify the geographic location associated with the information displayed in dashboard.

3.  Local Database / Data Dependence (web service alternative)

    In its current form, one must have a properly formatted and connected PostgreSQL database, with the appropriate data imported into the database. While the package provides instructions on how to replicate this environment, the tool would be much more widely accessible without this step. Further, the functionalities of this package coule be more widely available if the Shiny application is hosted as a web service. The authors of this package intend to explore the viability of this task in the future. In tandem with the functionality to delineate an AOI by hand on the map object, this would allow for a user to access and utilize this application with no requirements other than a web browser.

4.  Weighting Alternatives for Input Variables

    In its current form, this package replicates exactly the methodology from the CDC 2014 implementation [(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention et al. 2011)](https://svi.cdc.gov/Documents/Data/2014_SVI_Data/SVI2014Documentation.pdf). In this implementation, all 15 tier 1 input variables contribute equally to their respective thematic domain values. That is, each of the four variables that derive to the "Socio-Economic" domain make up 25% of that domain value, and both of the two variables that derive to the "Minority Status and Language" make up 50% of that domain. This manner of weighting input variables might not be appropriate for all contexts. It would be good to allow for a user specified weight matrix for the different input variables, that could customize a new index based on the SVI, that is designed for particular contexts and applications. 

5.  Margins of Error

    In its current form, this package works solely with variable estimate values. In addition to the input variable estimate values, there are also margin of error values that define a 90% confidence interval. We would like to incorporate this margin of error, and a methodology for displaying uncertainty within the Shiny application. At this point, the authors of the package have explored some possibilities with colleagues in the Geography department at Clark University. All approaches that have been discussed thus far are extremely computationally intensive, and the methods for displaying such uncertainty are complex. Incorporating these aspects is critically important if this tool is to be used in real world desicion making processes.
